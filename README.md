# Hackextend

Hey!
This project was done at the hackextend hackaton in tel aviv.
The project is an android app for a social peer to peer time barter for learning.
The platform provides its users an opportunity to teach skills they excel at and learn new skills they always wanted to in exchange.
The service is based on barter exchange, making the experience available for the whole community, building new friendships,
opportunities and fun memories.
